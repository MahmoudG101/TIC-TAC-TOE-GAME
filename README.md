# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
# Features
Multiplayer mode: Two Players are playing against each other
Single-player mode: Only Single Player is playing against an implemented smart algorithm that tries to win the game. 
This mode has two levels:
•	Easy level: if the user starts first.
•	Normal level: if the program starts first.
# Input
•	An input to select between the two modes.
•	The game should detect if draw or winning position occurred and who is the winner.
•	Input with the position of where to place your sign on the tic tac toe board using the NUMPAD.
•	 Enter “-1” to quit the game at any time during play.
•	After detection of the winner the game should ask if you want to play again to start from the beginning or it should quit.
# Algorithm
Single player mode is implemented by using MiniMax_alpha_beta algorithm.
A recursive or backtracking technique used in game theory and decision-making is the MiniMax Algorithm. It gives the optimum move for the player, assuming the opponent is also playing at their best during the game.
