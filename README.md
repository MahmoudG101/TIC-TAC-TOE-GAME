# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

## Features:
Multiplayer mode: Two Players are playing against each other.

Single-player mode: Only Single Player is playing against an implemented smart algorithm that tries to win the game. 

## Inputs:
•	An input to select between the two modes.

•	Input with the position of where to place your sign on the tic tac toe board using the NUMPAD.

•	The game detects if draw or winning position occurred and who is the winner.

•	Enter “-1” to quit the game at any time during the game.

•	After detection of the winner the game asks if you want to play again to start from the beginning or it should quit.

## Display:
The Software Displays: 

•	A Text that asks the user to choose between the Two Modes (single player or multiplayer).

•	The Board empty at the game beginning, then it displays the updated board after each player’s turn.

•	The number of the player whose turn it is and also displays which player of the two players is the winner. 

•	A guiding text that asks if the player wants to play again or if the player wants to quit the game.

## Algorithm:
Single player mode is implemented that tries to win the game against the user by using MiniMax_alpha_beta algorithm.

Minimax algorithm is a recursive or backtracking method used in game theory and decision-making. It gives the optimum move for the player, assuming the opponent is also playing at their best during the game.
